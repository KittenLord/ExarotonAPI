My implementation of Exaroton API, written in C#.

To do:
1. ~~Organize classes better, so it doesn't look bad~~
2. Create minecraft command builder/parser (possibly a separate project)
3. ~~Add queueing for WebsocketAPI~~
4. Add functionality regarding players (partially done)
5. Make ExarotonWebsocketClient class prettier
6. Make documentation
7. Apparently websocket API simply doesn't work on versions other than 1.16.5 (the only one I naively tested), so gotta fix that too
