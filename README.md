My implementation of Exaroton API, written in C#.

To do:
1. ~~Organize classes better, so it doesn't look bad~~
2. Create minecraft command builder/parser (possibly a separate project)
3. ~~Add queueing for WebsocketAPI~~
4. Add functionality regarding players (partially done)
5. Make ExarotonWebsocketClient class prettier
6. Make documentation
7. Add disconnect invalid-status/connect handling
8. Maybe add logger?
